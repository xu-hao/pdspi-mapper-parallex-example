          description: "The patient variable id maps to only one RequiredPatientVariable, which in turn, defines all the legal values (legalValues) for this id. The legalValues defines the type for the variableValue, and so can be used to inform the client on how to render the variableValue. The client can find the type by calling the '/config' endpoint, matching the 'id' with that in the 'RequiredPatientVariable' schema, and looking up 'legalValues'. The variableValue may also include the 'units' field, which is optional, and if left off, implies the system default units. NOTE: The 'variableValue' is actually an object type, but we use 'string' here to overcome a shortcoming of the swagger ui. This design choice was made in order to prioritize a better interactive documentation experience for the API user."
